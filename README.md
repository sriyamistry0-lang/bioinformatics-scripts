Neonatal Sepsis Transcriptomic Analysis
I replicated a study on neonatal sepsis using Python (Shaw et al. 2025). My analysis focuses on how the body's immune response and blood clotting systems react during infection.

Key Discoveries:
Neutrophil Activity: I found a strong negative correlation between ELANE (bacterial killing) and F3 (clotting spark).
System Failure: The negative correlation between MAP2K1 and SERPINE1 suggests that as cell survival signals drop, the body increases "clot-locking" proteins, which can lead to organ damage.
