Neonatal Sepsis Transcriptomic Analysis:
I replicated a study on neonatal sepsis correlating PADI4 with Coagulation genes using Python (Shaw et al. 2025). My analysis also focuses on how the body's immune response and blood clotting systemsinteract during infection particularly those genes that were suppressed in nonsurviving candidates.

Key Discoveries:
Neutrophil Activity: I found a strong negative correlation between ELANE (bacterial killing) and F3 (clotting spark).
System Failure: The negative correlation between MAP2K1 and SERPINE1 suggests that as cell survival signals drop, the body increases "clot-locking" proteins, which can lead to organ damage.
